                        {`"I have liked to face challenges, enjoys working under pressure and can keep calm in difficult
                        situations and circumstances. I believe that without the establishment of businesses, society
                        cannot progress. My academic background and experience in hospital facilities have shaped my
                        goal to establish a real-time rapid drug supply system, diagnostic service at home, delivering
                        medication directly to those in need. This is why I created PHARMATIC. My vision is to create
                        value and make a significant impact on society by improving healthcare and ensuring that good
                        quality medicine and treatment are accessible to every class of society."`}
